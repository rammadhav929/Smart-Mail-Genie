Smart Email Messaging with AI (Smart Mail Genie)
Description: This solution leverages the Gemini API and large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate messages based on user input. 
By integrating with Flask-Mail, it allows for seamless email sending. Users can input recipient details and the generated message, edit it if 
needed, and send it all from a single interface.

Advantages:
Quick Message Generation: Speeds up the process of drafting emails by generating messages based on input.
Reduced Manual Typing: Minimizes the amount of typing required, thanks to AI-generated content.
Enhanced Creativity: AI helps in generating ideas and content, enhancing the quality of communication.
Integrated Solution: Combines the message generation and sending process in one platform, eliminating the need to switch between a chatbot and Gmail.

To make code work we need to replace "todo" with api key, and add your gmail and password but don't use your original password.You should generate it by following below process.
1. App Passwords
What it is: An app password is a 16-digit passcode that gives less secure apps or devices permission to access your Google Account. You generate these passwords in your Google Account settings.
How to get it:
Go to your Google Account settings.
Navigate to the "Security" section.
Under "Signing in to Google," find "App passwords."
Generate a new app password and use this password in your Flask configuration.

Challenges:
Thought to create story generator with image by inputting text. Which was not fruitful, due to hugging api key where it is downloading pipeline due to it storage capcity exceeds.
Tried to create and advance capabilites of my voice assistant code using Gemini api key, but failed due to tkinker and pyttx3 packages are not working.
Tried to make them work but it was becoming mess.
At last i made easy useful thing.
I used idx for less time due to busy.
